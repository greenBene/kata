# RingBuffer

Develop a class that implements a ring buffer.

You can append values to the end of a ring buffer like on a list. You can take values from the front of the buffer. The difference to a list is that the ring buffer has a limited capacity. If it is full and you append a value, the oldest value is being overwritten.
